## Types of Inventory Management

There are different types of inventory management, each with its pros and cons, depending on a company's needs. Small businesses will often keep track of stock manually and determine the reorder points and quantities using spreadsheet (Excel) formulas, while larger businesses will use specialized enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.

## Markdown Optimization

Markdown optimization is the application of optimizing of reduction in the selling price by recommending best timing and depth of markdowns. The very first goal of markdown optimization in retail is to clear excess and unused inventory. Retailers apply markdown optimization methods to have optimal inventory in line with consumer demand. Fluctuating product lifecycles, seasonal demand, various assortments, variety of the customer base, new stores, price competition, and any other factors that may change after the initial decision-making point make the need for markdown optimization crucial.

## Successful Markdown Management

Successful markdown management starts with a deep understanding of your sales data and inventory levels. By regularly reviewing this information, retailers can identify trends, pinpoint underperforming products, and make informed decisions about when and how to implement markdowns. But keeping a close eye on your inventory levels isn’t always easy. Especially when you’re working with hundreds or even thousands of SKUs. Black swan events like a global pandemic can also throw a wrench in your inventory management plans. Let’s say you sell hand sanitizer products and experienced a massive influx of new customers during the pandemic. Naturally, you’d want to order a lot of inventory to satisfy that demand, however, properly monitoring your sales and inventory levels is of utmost importance during these times. Having access to a real-time inventory management platform provides retailers with the data they need to avoid purchasing too much inventory and then having to markdown prices.
